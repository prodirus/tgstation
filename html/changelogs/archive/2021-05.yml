  ATHATH:
  - spellcheck: The shivering symptom has been renamed to be the "chills" symptom,
      per Cobby's request.
  - bugfix: The shivering/chills symptom now actually chills you like it says it does
      instead of heating you up. fix Safe chills and safe fever should now use an
      infectee's species's body temperature's actual cold and heat damage thresholds,
      instead of just using the default ones.
  - balance: Maxed out, unsafe chills and maxed out, unsafe fevers can now make you
      slightly colder or hotter than they could before, respectively.

  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where space carps turned grey for a moment when attacking
      something.

  - qol: Replaced beige space carp variant with a light red one.

      to your eyes.

  - refactor: Cargo Shuttle consoles now rely a lot more on variables instead of hardcoding.

  - bugfix: The hotkey for dumping borg apparatus is now moved to Alt+Click instead

  - qol: Shattering a heretic blade as a heretic or a heretic monster to teleport

      of by pressing an action button. This information will be given to a heretic
      or a heretic monster if they examine a heretic blade.

      and produces a slightly different message (that factors in whether or not the

      method by the game.

      not just infiltrator gloves but blood orange.
